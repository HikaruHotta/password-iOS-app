# Backend
### This directory contains the Firebase Project for the backend of the game.


## /functions/

This folder houses code for Firebase Cloud Functions, which constitute the majority of the backend code. See the [folder's readme](./functions) for more info.

## /Public/

Any files in this folder will be hosted by Firebase when you run `firebase deploy`.  
Hosting is at this link: https://password-b77bd.web.app/

This currently includes a simple HTML page with some UI and Javascript that lets you make calls to the backend and display the results, with errors displaying in the browser console.
