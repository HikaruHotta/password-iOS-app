The Bot's basic functionality is the same as a player's: to play a word, given the last played word, 
and to vote to accept or reject each other player's played words.  
To play a word, with a certain probability the bot chooses on of the words on its list.  
Otherwise, the bot chooses the word with the closest cosine distance to the last played word + a randomly chosen 
target word on its list.

For voting, the bot rejects the word if it is not in the reject_threshold closest words by cosine distance to 
the last played word.

The Bot makes use of glove.6B.50d word embeddings.  

The Bot also stores all played words for potential future data analysis.
