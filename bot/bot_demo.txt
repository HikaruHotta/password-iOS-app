In example 1, we see player 2 score a point by causing player 1 to guess a word on player 2's target list.  Here, player 2 played "lending", which is very close to "credit", steering player 1 in that direction and scoring a point.

In example 2, we see that the word embedding combinations make some intuitive sense, as "hearing" for a crime is reasonable for the combination of "speech" and "autopsy".

In example 3, we see that player 2 steered the game towards the idea of "credit" while maintaining reasonable distance from the lat played word, "pipe", by playing "cut".

In example 4, we see the word embeddings make intuitive sense as player 1's word "musical" connects both compositions and theater, the last played word and the target.
